# About the Project
This project is a Battery Management System (<em>BMS</em>) that controls battery charging speed and includes a monitoring feature to display vital information. The system also provides protection against overcharging and overheating.

## Use of the Project
The current application of this <em>BMS</em> is limited in its hardware configuration compared to commercially available systems. However, it still serves as an effective introductory product for understanding Battery Management Systems. Nevertheless, Battery Management Systems are used in all applications involving battery cells, since most conventional batteries are not chemically identical in their composition. This can lead to voltage differences between the cells, potentially causing fires, contamination, or other dangerous side effects.

## Motive Behind the development
The main motivation for developing this project was my personal interest in learning more about hardware design and embedded systems. By working on a Battery Management System, I aimed to gain hands-on experience with practical electronics, circuit protection, and monitoring systems, while also building a foundation for understanding more advanced hardware projects in the future.
